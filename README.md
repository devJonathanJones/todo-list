# Basic To-Do List
A very basic to-do list app. First attempt at making one of these but I expect it will be fairly easy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

I created this project with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to freshen my memory of all 3 languages. I had a lot of fun with this project and got stumped a few times. I love a challenge though!


## Optimizations

### Mobile Responsive
First and foremost, I was in a bit of a rush on this one so I didn't get around to making it responsive for smaller screens. I'll definitely revisit this project in the future to correct that.

### Modular JavaScript
There were some parts of the javascript that were redundant and bits of code reused. A good improvement to be made is refining my code in a way that is less redundant.

## Lessons Learned:

I didn't really LEARN too too much from this. It was more of a reminder of what I already knew. I was challenged but I can't say that I learned much that I didn't already know. The learning starts once I've caught up to where I was before! 


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
